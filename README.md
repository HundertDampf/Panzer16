A Lego Tank using Arduino for Control and Steering
I made this programm during my second year of my programming education in form of a school project.

It was supposed to be a tank that drives on its own powered by two Lego motors. It had to detect obstacles on it's own and avoid them. 
Also it had to be able to turn the turret.

For Communicating i used a Arduion IR LED, controlled by a Libary from the internet and the normal Lego IR Reciever
